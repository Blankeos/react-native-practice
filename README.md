<h1>React Native Practice</h1>

This will serve as my practice repo for React Native projects
since I'll be doing a lot of this in my company.

Here are my goal projects:

### Master UI building and primitives

- [x] A counter app - to learn basic UI.
- [ ] Todo - basic state with saving
- [ ] Pomodoro timer - intermediate state
- [ ] Splash screen and pokemon dashboard - learn page transitions and onboarding.
- [ ] Real-time drawing - learn canvas and state
- [ ] Something with mobx.

### Master device-specific

- [ ] File-system
- [ ] Camera
- [ ] Geo
- [ ] Device to Device communication or Bluetooth.
